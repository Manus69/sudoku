## This program solves sudoku puzzles. To use the program, clone the repository and run "make". To solve a sudoku, put it in a text file and give the path to it to the program as follows: ./sudoku [path]. If the path is not provided, the program reads "sudoku.txt" in the program root directory. The file must contain the puzzle, that has the following form:
## 1 5 _ _ 4 _ 2 8 7
## 6 8 _ _ _ _ _ _ 5
## _ _ 9 _ _ _ _ _ _
## _ 7 _ 3 9 _ _ 4 _
## 8 3 1 _ 2 _ 7 5 9
## _ 4 _ _ 5 1 _ 2 _
## _ _ _ _ _ _ 9 _ _
## 5 _ _ _ _ _ _ 7 6
## 3 9 2 _ 6 _ _ 1 8
## The solution is obtained via backtracking with pivoting, so the program might be slow on some inputs.
